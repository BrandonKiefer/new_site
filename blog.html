            So I've decided to create a blog page on my website even though the idea seems so corny. But I think it's a good idea because it will help me stay engaged with my website,
            updating my github, and my ultimate goal--- <b>employment as a coder</b>.
            <br/>
        </br>
            Some ideas I already for this blog include replacing this hardcoded blog post with a form on the page that will let me just post a string from there. That should be a fun project.
            I'm interested in making a game as well-- just for fun of course. While perusing my github today I ran across some of my earliest projects in Javascript, a terminal-based "choose your own adventure" game.
            I think if you can make a compelling text-based game, it might be even more fun with some graphics! It's just a thought though.
            <br/>
    </br>
        This is embarrassing but it gave me the inspiration to start this blog in the first place, I just realized about an hour ago that I left off something very important on my resume (which I've already sent to hundreds and hundreds of people)-- and that would be my academic awards.
        Maybe I took them off in the first place because I was told that they're not going to be important to the employer and just take up space. 
        Even if that's true, and I'm honestly skeptical about that, those awards are important to me and I want them on there. I worked hard for them and how else am I going to standout from the crowd?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I started going through the Javascript Certification on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> a couple of days ago and I'm kind of hooked! It's been totally the opposite of my Leetcode experience. 
    I'm at 43% right now and hope to maybe have it completed by the end of the day on Monday. In the meantime, I'm taking notes from a Java course I'm taking on Udemy, and I'm looking to start contributing to some open-source projects on github!
